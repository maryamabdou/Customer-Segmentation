# Customer-Segmentation
## Project Overview
This project aims to segment customers of an e-commerce platform using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The segmentation is based on customer demographic information and transactional behavior. By identifying distinct customer groups, the business can target specific segments with tailored offers, particularly focused on maximizing loyalty and satisfaction through coupon distribution.

The dataset consists of five interrelated tables containing information about customers, transactions, branches, and merchants. These tables have been merged and processed to extract meaningful features for clustering.

## Feature Selection
The features used for customer segmentation include:

Demographic Features: gender_name, city_name. <br>
Transactional Features: <br>
Frequency of transactions: Number of transactions per customer.
Transaction status: Whether the coupon was claimed or burnt.
Coupon usage: Different types of coupons used by customers.
Merchant name: Merchant with whom the transaction occurred.
These features are selected based on their ability to describe customer behavior.
